**Before**
```ini
# Generated by NetworkManager
search cyber.range
nameserver 10.0.0.1
```

**After**
```ini
# Generated by NetworkManager
search cyber.range za.tryhackme.com
nameserver 10.200.54.101 
nameserver 10.0.0.1
# Shorten name resolution timeouts to 1 second
options timeout:1
# Only attempt to resolve a hostname 2 times
options attempts:2
```

**Restart Settings**
```sh
systemctl restart networking.service
```

**To Reset the resolv.conf File**
```sh
service NetworkManager restart
```


**Why does this work?**
You're instructing the DNS resolution service to search between `10.200.54.101` **and** `10.0.0.1` . So, let's say you say something like this:
```shell
nslookup google.com
```

What's happening is this:
1.  First ask `10.200.54.101` – "Do you know the IP address of `google.com`?"
    -   If the domain controller answers, then stop the lookup process.
    -   If the domain controller doesn't have the answer, move on.
2.  Then, ask `10.0.0.1` – "Do you know the IP address of `google.com`?"
