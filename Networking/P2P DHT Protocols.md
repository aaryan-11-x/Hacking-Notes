Peer-to-peer Distributed Hash Table (DHT) protocols are a class of protocols used in decentralized networks to efficiently distribute and look up key-value pairs across a distributed system. DHTs enable the decentralization of data storage and retrieval by distributing the responsibility of maintaining a global hash table across participating peers.

#### Chord
Chord is one of the earliest DHT protocols designed for use in peer-to-peer networks. It uses a circular key space and ensures that each node is responsible for a specific range of keys. Chord employs a simple but effective finger table for routing.

#### Kademlia
Kademlia is a popular DHT protocol known for its simplicity and efficiency. It organizes nodes in a binary tree structure, and each node maintains a list of "K" nodes (known as the k-bucket) for each distance metric. Kademlia is widely used in decentralized systems, including the BitTorrent network and Ethereum.

#### Pastry
Pastry is a DHT protocol that organizes nodes in a tree-like structure called a "prefix tree". It uses the proximity of keys in a numeric space to efficiently route messages to the appropriate node. Pastry is designed to be scalable and fault-tolerant.
Nodes and data items are *m-bit* identifiers that create an identifier space of power(2,m) distributed uniformly on a circle in clockwise direction. The **common value of m is 128**.

#### CAN (Content-Addressable Network)
CAN is a DHT protocol that represents the DHT keys and values in a multi-dimensional Cartesian coordinate space. It is based on a grid overlay network, and each node is responsible for a region in the coordinate space. CAN provides efficient lookup and supports dynamic node join and leave operations.

#### Tapestry
Tapestry is a DHT protocol inspired by Pastry and organized as an overlay mesh network. It uses a prefix routing algorithm, similar to Pastry, but employs a different structure for routing tables. Tapestry is designed for efficient lookup and fault tolerance.

#### Koorde
Koorde is a DHT protocol derived from Chord, with improvements in terms of scalability and efficiency. It uses a similar circular key space and finger table structure but includes optimizations to reduce the number of finger table entries maintained by each node.

#### SkipGraph
SkipGraph is a DHT protocol that builds a Skip List overlay network. It provides efficient lookup and insertion operations by maintaining a structured hierarchy of nodes. SkipGraph is designed to be resilient to node failures and provides good search performance.

#### Viceroy
Viceroy is a DHT protocol that organizes nodes in a hierarchical structure similar to a tree. It utilizes randomization to distribute keys across nodes efficiently. Viceroy provides logarithmic height and efficient routing, making it suitable for large-scale systems.
