Esoteric Programming Language **from Hell**!

Malbolge is a programming language that was designed to be intentionally difficult to program in. It was created in 1998 by Ben Olmstead, who was inspired by a passage in Dante’s “Inferno” that describes the ninth circle of Hell as being named “Malbolge.” Olmstead designed Malbolge to be a deliberately difficult language to program in, with a syntax that is intentionally confusing and a set of instructions that are counterintuitive.
