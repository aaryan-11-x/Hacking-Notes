**PIET** is an esoteric programming language that is unique and unconventional in its design. It is primarily a graphical and visual programming language, where *programs are* represented as abstract, colorful, and *intricate images*.

**Abstract Images**: In PIET, programs are represented as abstract images, usually composed of colored blocks or pixels. These images are called "programs" or "Piet programs."

**Color-Based Commands**: PIET uses the colors in the images to represent commands and instructions. Each color block corresponds to a specific command. For example, different colors might represent addition, subtraction, loop control, or I/O operations.

**Pointer Movement**: A "pointer" moves around the image, interpreting the colors it encounters as commands. The pointer can move in different directions, including *left, right, up, and down*, based on the program's logic.

**Stack-Based**: PIET is stack-based, meaning that it relies on a stack data structure to store and manipulate data during execution. Operations often involve pushing and popping values onto and from the stack.
