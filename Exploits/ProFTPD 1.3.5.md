First, Try [[msfconsole]] Exploit. If **not working**, then try the *below steps*.

Exploit name is **mod_copy**!
The mod_copy module implements **SITE CPFR** and **SITE CPTO** commands, which can be used to *copy files/directories from one place to another on the server*. Any unauthenticated client can leverage these commands to copy files from any part of the filesystem to a chosen destination.

Use [[Netcat & Ncat]] to connect to the **FTP Port**.

```sh
# Copy From
SITE CPFR [file path]

# Copy To
SITE CPTO [copy to path]
```
