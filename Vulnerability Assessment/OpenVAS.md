# Configurations
If you navigate to the `Configurations` tab and select `Targets`, you will see targets that have been already added to the application.

For the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Alive Test</mark>, the Scan Config Default option from OpenVAS leverages the `NVT Ping Host` in the [NVT Family](https://docs.greenbone.net/GSM-Manual/gos-6/en/scanning.html#vulnerabilitymanagement-create-target).
Typically, an <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">authenticated scan</mark> leverages a high privileged user such as root or Administrator.


# Setting up a Scan
Multiple scan configurations leverage <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">OpenVAS Network Vulnerability Test (NVT) Families</mark>, which consist of many different categories of vulnerabilities, such as ones for Windows, Linux, Web Applications, etc. You can see a few different types of families shown below:![[Pasted image 20231108091058.png]]

OpenVAS has various scan configurations to choose from for scanning a network. We recommend only leveraging the ones below, as other options could cause system disruptions on a network:

- **Base**: This scan configuration is meant to enumerate information about the host's status and operating system information. This scan configuration does not check for vulnerabilities.

- **Discovery**: This scan configuration is meant to enumerate information about the system. The configuration identifies the host's services, hardware, accessible ports, and software being used on the system. This scan configuration also does not check for vulnerabilities.

- **Host Discovery**: This scan configuration solely tests whether the host is alive and determines what devices are active on the network. This scan configuration does not check for vulnerabilities as well. OpenVAS leverages ping to identify if the host is alive.

- **System Discovery**: This scan enumerates the target host further than the 'Discovery Scan' and attempts to identify the operating system and hardware associated with the host.

- **Full and fast**: This configuration is recommended by OpenVAS as the safest option and leverages intelligence to use the best NVT checks for the host(s) based on the accessible ports.

# Exporting Results
![[Pasted image 20231108091718.png]]

We will export our results in XML and use the [openvasreporting](https://github.com/TheGroundZero/openvasreporting) tool by the TheGroundZero. The openvasreporting tool offers various options when generating output. We are using the **standard option** for an Excel file for this report.

```sh
pip install OpenVAS-Reporting
```
```sh
openvasreporting -i [OpenVAS xml file(s)] [-o [Output file]] [-f [Output format]] [-l [minimal threat level (n, l, m, h, c)]] [-t [docx template]]

# This command will generate an excel document like the one below
openvasreporting -i report-2bf466b5-627d-4659-bea6-1758b43235b1.xml -f xlsx
```
