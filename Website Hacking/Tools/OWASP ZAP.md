# Advanatages over Burpsuite
- **Automated Web Application Scan**: This will automatically passively and actively scan a web application, build a sitemap, and discover vulnerabilities. This is a paid feature in Burp. 

- **Web Spidering**: You can passively build a website map with Spidering. This is a paid feature in Burp.

- **Unthrottled Intruder**: You can bruteforce login pages within OWASP as fast as your machine and the web-server can handle. This is a paid feature in Burp.

- **No need to forward individual requests through Burp**: When doing manual attacks, having to change windows to send a request through the browser, and then forward in burp, can be tedious. OWASP handles both and you can just browse the site and OWASP will intercept automatically. This is NOT a feature in Burp.
