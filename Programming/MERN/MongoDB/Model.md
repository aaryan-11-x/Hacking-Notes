In a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) application, the "models" folder is like a blueprint for the data your app uses. Imagine you're building a house; you need plans that show how the rooms, doors, and windows are arranged. In the same way, the "models" folder contains plans for your app's data.

```powershell
# Install MongoDB
npm i mongoose
```

For example, let's say you're building a *blog application*. You might have a "Post" model in your "models" folder that defines the structure of a blog post, including its title, content, author, and publication date. You can also include methods to create, retrieve, update, and delete blog posts.
```js
// models/Post.js

const mongoose = require('mongoose');

1) Create a schema
2) Convert schema to model

// Define the Post schema
const postSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  content: {
    type: String,
    required: true,
  },
  author: {
    type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
    ref: 'User', // Reference to the User model
  },
  createdAt: {
    type: Date,
    default: Date.now,
  },
  experiences: [{      // Array because there can be more than one experiences (workplaces) & contains sub-headers
        type: String,
        required: true
    }],
});

// Create the Post model
const Post = mongoose.model('Post', postSchema);

// Export the Post model for use in other parts of the application
module.exports = Post;
```
