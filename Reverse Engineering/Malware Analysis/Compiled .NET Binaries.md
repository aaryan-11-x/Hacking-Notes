.NET binaries are compiled files containing code written in languages compatible with the .NET framework, such as **C#, VB.NET, F#, or managed C++**. These binaries are executable files (with the `.exe` extension) or dynamic link libraries (DLLs with the `.dll` extension). They can also be assemblies that contain multiple types and resources.

Compared to other programming languages like C or C++, languages that use .NET, such as C#, don't directly translate the code into machine code after compilation. Instead, they use an intermediate language (IL), like a pseudocode, and translate it into native machine code during runtime via a Common Language Runtime (CLR) environment.

This may be a bit overwhelming. *In simple terms, it's only possible to analyze a C or C++ compiled binary by reading its assembly instructions (low-level). Meanwhile, a C# binary can be decompiled and its source code retrieved since the intermediate language contains metadata that can be reconverted to its source code form.*


# Decompile Malware with dnSpy
**dnSpy** is an open-source .NET assembly (C#) debugger and editor. It is typically used for reverse engineering .NET applications and analysing their code and is primarily designed for examining and modifying .NET assemblies in a user-friendly, interactive way. It's also capable of modifying the retrieved source code (editing), setting breakpoints, or running through the code one step at a time (debugging).
