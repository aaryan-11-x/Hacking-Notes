A Payload is **a piece of code that executes when hackers exploit a vulnerability**. In other words, it's an exploit module.

**Stage0** of a staged payload represents the initial shellcode sent over the network to the target machine's vulnerable service, which has the sole purpose of initializing a connection back to the attacker machine. This is what is known as a reverse connection.
After the stable communication channel is established between the attacker and the victim, the attacker machine will most likely send an even bigger payload stage which should grant them shell access. This larger payload would be the **Stage1** payload.

***Exploit Successful होगा  तो ही  Payload काम करेगा
